# Additionals

Here I keep some additional projects, some are just a functioning parts that can be added to bigger projects, some are just stand-alone projects.

This repository is up to date. This means, when I finish something, then i will upload it here.

You will find here HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and in future some Back-End projects.

Navigate via branches, where the overall name is displayed, which can lead you to what this project is and with wich technology it was used.
